# Bike-Sharing-Visualization
Tableau Storyboard

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.
However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

Task
The task  is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.
	* 
Design 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomena (4-10 total).
	* 
2 Dashboards (1 for each phenomena)
	* 
1 City Official Map
	* 
A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.
	* 
1 Storyboard




Method
First the data was downloaded from the Citi Bike Data webpage
The data was cleaned and CRUD performed in Jupyter Notebook "CRUD bike data.ipynb"
Cleaned data was unionised in Tableau and the following:

Results
Discovery of the 2 phenomena:
1) Gender gap - citi bike sharing system is used triple the amount more by males than females
2) People born in 1969, was surprisingly, ranked as one of the highest users of the bike system

City Official Map
A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.
Storyboard
Tableau storyboard that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.
